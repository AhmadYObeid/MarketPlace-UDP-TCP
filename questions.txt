1) Is the RQ# managed by the server side. A number generated by the server to identify each client

imo: It is created by the server to be able to identify each client. Since the server will be multithreaded, if multiple registrations happen at the same time, the server should have a way to
indicate which user was registered first.

2) Shoud the ip, udp and tcp be automatically generated by the client's system when a user registers or they are manually entered by the client who is registering
